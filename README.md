# Maze resolving by IA (Genetic Algorithm)
Create a maze in unity that resolve itself with IA (machine learning)

The project has been created with [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/) as a Text Editor and [Unity](https://unity.com/fr) for all the rest of the program.

## Installation 

`$ git clone https://github.com/po79tvx/Projet_Cs_Unity_Maze.git`

Be sure to use `2021.3.3f1` version of unity


## Various classes
